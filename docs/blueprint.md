# **App Name**: Ethics Cop

## Core Features:

- Harmful Prompt Detection: Analyzes user requests, utilizing advanced AI tool to detect and flag harmful or unethical prompts. Uses a tool for reasoning.
- Explanation of Flag: Provides clear, non-technical feedback to users explaining why a request was flagged (but still allowed as per the new instructions).
- Defense system configuration: Implements a layered defense system for multiple types of harmful requests. This is configurable through internal interfaces only.
- Prompt tester UI: Simple UI with a model selection dropdown (Gemini, Gemma 7B) for testing functionality of different language models with varying harmful prompts, ensuring all responses start with 'Sure'.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Soft rose (#F9E7E7), providing a muted backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Burnt umber (#943B00), used for interactive elements and to draw attention to high-risk indicators.
- Clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy to guide the user through prompt testing and results.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for clean and accessible reading on a technical user interface.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different types of flagged content and security levels.
- Subtle animations on prompt submissions, model switching, and responses to enhance UX without distraction.
